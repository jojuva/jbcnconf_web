We need a way to call our microservices and be resilient to distributed systems failures â€” as a first-class implementation.\n\nPrevious generations of tools solving these problems were built at Twitter or Netflix but did so with application libraries. However, for each combination of platform/language/framework we use to build microservices we need to consistently solve for the following critical functions\n\n* routing / traffic shaping\n* adaptive/clientside loadbalancing\n* service discovery\n* circuit breaking\n* timeouts / retries \n* rate limiting\n* metrics/logging/tracing\n* fault injection\n\nDoing all of these things in application-layer libraries across all your languages and all your frameworks becomes incredibly complex and expensive to maintain. In this talk, I'll introduce you to Envoy Proxy and Istio.io Service Mesh, discuss how they solve these problems more elegantly by pushing these concerns down to the infrastructure layer, and show demos of how it all works.

If you never heard of Kotlin EE, don't panic, it does not exist. But you can use it right away and boost your productivity!\n\nI invented the term Kotlin EE as a synonym for using the Kotlin language together with the Java EE API to create services of any size (microservices, nanoservices etc.) with just a few lines of code and the ability to focus on the business logic.\n\nKotlin and Java EE are a perfect couple for writing micro- or nanoservices. Kotlin is a very pragmatic language, builds on many concepts and techniques from Java, designed for developer productivity. Kotlin works great with all existing Java libraries and frameworks and runs with the same level of performance as Java.\n\nThe Java EE API allows us to code against a proven and stable API. Provided libraries like JAX-RS for writing RESTful APIs and Jackson for JSON (de)serializing decrease the need for additional third-party libraries which results in a short build time and a small artifact size. Benefit from a very fast build and test feedback and stay focused on your code.\n\nIn this talk, I try to prove my statements from above. Live on stage I write a service in Kotlin with a RESTful JSON API with only a few lines of code and run the service using a local Docker cloud where you can see how these can be scaled up and down to manage fluctuating loads.

Based on these two assumptions we will go over three main points: Data, Failure and Automation.\n\nAt the end of this talk you will have a good idea of all the questions you will ask yourself when deploying software on the cloud and the different possible answers. Our goal is not to go in depth in all these concepts.

In this talk I will present three challenges we observed in real-life projects and discuss how to avoid them.\n\n1. Communication is complex. With everything being distributed failures are normal so you need sophisticated failure handling strategies (e.g. stateful retry).\n2. Asynchronicity requires you to handle timeouts. This is not only about milliseconds, systems get much more resilient when you can wait for minutes, hours or even longer.\n3. Distributed transactions cannot simply be delegated to protocols like XA. So you need to solve the requirement to retain consistency in case of failures.\n\nI will not only use slides but also demonstrate concrete source code examples available on GitHub.","type":"talk","tags":["Distributed Systems","Microservices","Integration","Consistency"],"level":"beginner","speakers":["QmVybmRSdWVja2VyYmVybmQucnVlY2tlckBjYW11bmRhLmNvbQ=="],"scheduleId":"#TUE-TC6-SE4"};

Finally we will show you a complete microservice application with DB and polyglot backed services.\n\nYou bring your curiosity and willingness to code and we will teach all you need to go home and start building pure awesomeness on OpenShift.<br/><br/><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Requirements for the workshop:</span>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://bit.ly/openshift-workshop-prereqs\" style=\"text-decoration: underline; color: blue;\" target=\"_blank\">Follow this link</a>","type":"workshop","tags":["java","kubernetes","cloud","paas","containers"],"scheduleId":"#WED-TC4-SE4","level":"beginner","speakers":["b33fa71d4efd0c60b13345115cb00f92c352394c","ff55294f8464ef742da59a126c35e25670d377dc"]};

Even updates to Java in recent years have removed unnecessary syntax. While this is clearly meant to be a Good Thing, many of us - particularly if we've been writing Java for a long time - think \"so what?\". Our IDEs can generate code, and our brains get used to ignoring the stuff that doesn't matter. \n\nIs the removal of extraneous code from the syntax of a language necessary, or just a gimmick? How does it impact our ability to write and read code? \n\nIn this talk, Trisha will explore common coding scenarios using Java and Kotlin. We'll see what's important for developers to write (and, more importantly, read) and what can be removed. We'll also see how Java has evolved to improve our productivity as producers and consumers of code, and why understanding new languages and staying up to date with the features of Java can ultimately make your life easier.","type":"talk","tags":["Java","Kotlin"],"level":"middle","file":"JBCN_DIA 12/SALA 13/180612_JBCN_TRISHA GEE_13_2.mp4","video":"7JMmm2XuifE","speakers":["5778ef29f1bfba305f2684b45f585d6655728e10"],"scheduleId":"#TUE-TC2-SE2"};
